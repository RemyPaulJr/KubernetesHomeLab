I will be using helm to install the applications I'm running.

- I like to think of helm as a package manager for Kubernetes. That helps me understand it's use case.

- Rather than creating entire yaml files to use services like grafana and argocd, I can use a single helm comnmand to install it, and manage it using charts with a yaml file.

- Helm tracks installed releases and versions, making it easy to upgrade, rollback, or uninstall apps.
